# Rustamjon Kodirkhonov

I am a dedicated and adaptable professional with a dual academic background in Computer Science and Hotel & Tourism Management from Sejong University, Seoul. My journey combines technical knowledge, hands-on work experience, and a strong desire for continuous growth.

Currently focusing on JavaScript-based development, I am expanding my expertise in frameworks such as Next.js, Express.js, and Fastify, while building a solid foundation in MongoDB and MySQL for backend and data management tasks. I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly web applications and continuously learning best practices in modern software development.

Alongside development, I am also exploring the fundamentals of cybersecurity, aiming to strengthen my technical depth and practical awareness in a field that increasingly affects every industry.

## Core Interests and Skills:
- Frontend Development (JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS)
- Web Frameworks (Next.js, Express.js)
- Databases (MongoDB, MySQL)
- Project-Based Learning (MERN Stack, JAMstack)
- Cybersecurity Fundamentals
- Strong communication, customer service, and teamwork from hospitality and logistics experience

Whether contributing as a junior front-end developer, participating in cross-functional teams, or supporting business operations with technical insight, I bring reliability, a learning mindset, and a collaborative spirit to any role.

I am currently based in Seoul and open to global opportunities in tech or roles where technology meets business.
